### Custom Objects

Custom objects are useful when we have many variables that are better off grouped together. For example, if we are creating a program that draws circles, we can make a circle object that has properties for its coordinates, size, colours, and any other information.

Here is a program we saw earlier.

```javascript
let x = 0; // declares the variable x and assigns it a value of 0

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(128);
    frameRate(5);
}

function draw() {
    ellipse(x, x, 100); 
    x = x + 50; // changes x to be 50 more than before
}
```

The syntax for a custom object looks like this:

```js
let circle = { // "let" followed by the object name, the assignment operator, and an opening brace
    x: 0, // the list of properties, with the key and value separated by a colon
    y: 0,
    diameter: 100 
} // a closing brace after all the properties are listed
```

Once we define `circle` like that, we use `circle.x` and `circle.diameter` instead of `x` and `diameter`.

Here's what the program looks like now. It does the same thing as before but now it's easier to read and debug if needed.

```js
let circle = { // circle is an object 
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    diameter: 100
}

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(128);
    frameRate(5);
}

function draw() {
  ellipse(circle.x, circle.y, circle.diameter); // dot notation is used to get the values in the circle object
  circle.x += 50; // increments work on object keys
  circle.y += 50; // increments work on object keys
}
```

We can add more properties if we want, such as the colours of the circle. Since each colour has three properties, we can make the colour an object with three fields. 

```js
let circle = { // circle is an object 
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    diameter: 100,
    colour: {
        r: 50,
        g: 205,
        b: 50
  }
}

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(128);
    frameRate(5);
    fill(circle.colour.r, circle.colour.g, circle.colour.b) // dot notation looks like this when you have an object inside an object
}
  
function draw() {
    ellipse(circle.x, circle.y, circle.diameter); 
    circle.x += 50; 
    circle.y += 50; 
}
```
