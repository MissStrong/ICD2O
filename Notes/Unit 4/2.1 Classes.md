### Objects

This approach to creating objects is creates an **object literal**:

```js
let circle = { // circle is an object 
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    diameter: 100,
    colour: {
        r: 50,
        g: 205,
        b: 50
  }
}
```

It is useful to create object literals when we have one or a few objects in our program that we don't need to reuse. If we want to reuse the same object multiple times, then we should use a **class** instead.

### Classes

A **class** is a blueprint for an object. Variables that are defined inside of a class are called **fields**. Functions that are defined inside of a class are called **methods**. Every class has a method called `constructor()` that creates an object with the properties of the class.

This is what it would look like if we used a class instead of an object literal. The keyword `this` is used to set or access the fields.

```js
class Circle {
    constructor() {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
        this.diameter = 100; 
        this.colour = new Colour();
    }
}

class Colour {
    constructor() {
        this.r = 50;
        this.g = 205;
        this.b = 50; 
    }
}
```

One advantage of using a class instead of an object literal is that we can create as many objects as we want from a class. Here is an example that reuses the same class to create new objects.

```js
class Circle {
    constructor() {
        this.x = random(width);
        this.y = random(width);
        this.diameter = random(80, 120); 
        this.colour = new Colour();
    }
}

class Colour {
    constructor() {
        this.r = random(255);
        this.g = random(255);
        this.b = random(255);
    }
}

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(128);
    frameRate(5);
}

function draw() {
    circle = new Circle();
    fill(circle.colour.r, circle.colour.g, circle.colour.b);
    ellipse(circle.x, circle.y, circle.diameter);
}
```
