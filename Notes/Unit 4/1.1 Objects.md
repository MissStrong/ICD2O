### Objects

An **object** is a data type, just like numbers, strings, and booleans. Objects contain **properties** that tell us more information about it.

### Image Objects

Whenever we create an image in a program, the image is actually an object.

```js
let doge;

function preload() {
    doge = loadImage("https://codehs.com/uploads/62d8eab544d31b81511d731d11ef6c00");
}

function setup() {
    createCanvas(doge.width, doge.height);
    image(doge, 0, 0);
}
```

We can access the properties within an object using **dot notation**. We write the object name followed by a dot followed by the **key** (the name of the property) we want to use. For example, `doge.width` gives us `525`, and `doge.height` gives us `394`.
