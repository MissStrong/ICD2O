### Attributes

An attribute is a parameter in a tag that causes the element to behave in specific way. 

Attributes are written inside the opening tag. They precede the tag name and are followed by a `=` and the value of the attribute.

Here is an example:

```html
<html lang="en">
```

The attribute `lang` within an `<html>` tag specifies the language of the webpage. The value for English is `"en"`. We can find values of other languages by looking up the [ISO 639-1 Language Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
