### Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks use the **anchor tag** `<a>`. An **anchor** is text that contains a hyperlink. For example, in the hyperlink [click me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSRN3hjzVkQ), the anchor is the text "click me". 

Anchor tags require a **hypertext reference** `href` attribute to tell the browser what URL to go to when the hyperlink is clicked. 

We can also specify whether clicking on the link will open the webpage in a new tab or the same tab. By default they will open in the same tab, but we can specify the `target` attribute to be a new tab `'_blank'`.

When a tag has more than one attribute, they can be placed in any order separated by spaces. 

Here is the previous "click me" example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
    <head>
        <title>Hyperlink</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSRN3hjzVkQ' target='_blank'>click me</a>
    </body>
</html>
```
