### CSS Basics

A `.css` file can be used to add styling to a webpage. CSS stands for Cascade Style Sheet.

To link a `.css` file to an `.html` file, we use the self-closing `<link>` tag and the following attributes:
* `href` (hypertext reference – the name of the css file)
* `rel` (relationship – the connection between the HTML and CSS file, `stylesheet`)
* `type` (file type – the filetype of the CSS file `text/css`) . This line goes in the header.

```html
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```
