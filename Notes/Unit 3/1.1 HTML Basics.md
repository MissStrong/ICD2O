### What is HTML?

**Hypertext Markup Language** (HTML) is a language used to display **hypertext** on a webpage. Hypertext is formatted and/or styled text that can include links to other sites. All webpages on the Internet are stored and sent as HTML files.

There are several versions of HTML. The current one is called HTML5.

HTML files have the extention `.html`. The filename `index.html` indicates a homepage of a website.

### Required HTML Tags

HTML code consists of **tags**. Tags use angular brackets `<>`. There are two types of tags: **opening tags** and **closing tags**. Every closing tag matches an opening tag. Closing tags contain a forward slash `/` whereas opening tags do not. Every set of opening and closing tags create an **element**. All HTML5 files require the following tags:

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that we're using HTML5. The exclamation point indicates that this tag is a **declaration** (it declares information to the browser).
* `<html>` and `</html>` indicate the part of the file that contains the HTML code, except for the `DOCTYPE` declaration. 
* `<head>` and `</head>` indicate the part of the file that contains **metadata** about the webpage. This includes the title, encoding information, and other properties of the webpage.
* `<title>` and `</title>` indicate the **title** of the webpage. This title appears on the tab in the browser.
* `<body>` and `</body>` indicate the part of the file that contains the **content** of the webpage.

Here's what it looks like all together. Whenever we have a tag inside a tag, there is an additional indent. Depending on how much content is between an opening tag and its corresponding closing tag, the opening and closing tags could be on the same line or on different lines.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Webpage Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello World!
    </body>
</html>
```

Here's what this webpage looks like:
