### Booleans

There are two **Boolean values**: `true` and `false`. Although they are words, they are not strings (there are no quotation marks around them). The word "Boolean" is named after George Boole, a logician from the 1800s. 

The variables `mouseIsPressed` and `keyIsPressed` are some examples of built-in Boolean variables in P5.js.

*  `mouseIsPressed` is `true` when the mouse is currently being pressed down, and `false` otherwise.
*  `keyIsPressed` is `true` when any key on the keyboard is currently being pressed down, and `false` otherwise.

```js
function draw() {
    print(mouseIsPressed); // continuously prints true or false depending on whether the mouse is being pressing down
}
```

### Boolean Expressions

We can create **Boolean expressions** using various types of operators.

### Comparison operators

These compare the magnitudes of two numbers to produce a `true` or `false` statement.

Examples:

* `x < width`
* `mouseY <= 200`
* `mouseX > height/2`
* `mouseX >= width` 

`<=` is supposed to look like the ≤ symbol and `>=` is supposed to look like the ≥ symbol.

## Equality operators

These check whether two numbers are equal or not equal to produce a `true` or `false` statement.

* `colour == 255`
* `mouseX != 0`

`!=` is supposed to look like the ≠ symbol

In JavaScript, we also have `===` and `!==` when we want to ensure that the two values belong to the same data type. For now we can stick with `==` and `!==`.

### Boolean operators

These combine two or more Boolean expressions to produce a `true` or `false` statement. 

* `!mouseIsPressed`
* `0 <= mouseX && mouseX <= width`
* `0 <= mouseX || 0 <= mouseY`

`!` means "not". `&&` means "and". `||` means "or".

### Order of Operations

In arithmetic, the order of operations is BEDMAS, but what about all the other operations we've seen so far?

If we do not use any brackets, this is the order from highest precedence to lowest precedence:

1. `(` and `)`
2. `!`
4. `*` and `/`
5. `+` and `-`
6. `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`
7. `==`, `!=`, `===`, and `!==`
8. `&&`
9. `||`
10. `=`

In general we should use brackets when we have an expression that has many operators so that we don't have to memorize the order of operations.
