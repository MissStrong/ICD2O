### Conditionals

Previously we saw how to use the conditional keyword `if`. Another conditional keyword is `else`, which is used alongside `if`. 

An `else` block only runs when the previous `if` condition was not met. We can think of it like the word "otherwise". Here is an example that draws circles when the mouse is pressed down and otherwise draws squares.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(128);
    rectMode(CENTER);
}

function draw() {
    if (mouseIsPressed) { 
        ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50); // the circles show up when the mouse is pressed down
    } else {
        rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50); // the squares show up when the mouse is not pressed down
  }
}
```

This example draws different coloured circles depending on where the cursor is. It first checks whether it's in the top-left quadrant, then if it isn't there it checks the top-right quadrant, and if it's not there it can deduce that it's in the bottom half.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(250);
    stroke(100); // grey
    strokeWeight(5);
    line(0, height/2, width, height/2); // draws lines to separate the canvas into quarters
    line(width/2, 0, width/2, height);
    ellipseMode(CENTER);
    noStroke();
}

function draw() {
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 20);
    if (mouseX <= width/2 && mouseY <= height/2) { // if the cursor is in the top-right quarter
        fill(247, 168, 184); // amaranth pink
    } else if (mouseX >= width/2 && mouseY <= height/2) { // if the cursor is in the top-left quarter
        fill(85, 205, 252); // maya blue
    } else { // if the cursor is in the bottom half
        fill(244, 241, 134); // soft yellow
    }
}
```
