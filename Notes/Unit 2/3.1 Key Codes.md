### Built-In Constants

We've come across the following **built-in constants**. They are built into P5.js and their values *do not change* while the program is running.

* `CENTER`, `CORNER`, and `CORNERS`
* `DEGREES` and `RADIANS`
* `CHORD`, `PI`, and `OPEN`
* `RIGHT`, `LEFT`, `TOP`, and `BOTTOM`
* `NORMAL`, `ITALIC`, `BOLD`, and `BOLDITALIC`

However, we can also make our own **custom constants** too. Just like custom variables, custom constants need to be declared and assigned a value. 

### Custom Contants

When we declare a constant we use the keyword `const` and then we give it a name. All constants have block scope, so the location we declare it in affects where we can access it.

In JavaScript, the convention is to name constants using **screaming snake case**, which is a variation of **snake case**. In snake case, all words are lower case and separated by underscores `_`. Snake case is used in languages like Python (which happens to be type of snake). In screaming snake case, all words are upper case and separated by underscores (imagine that the snake is screaming).

### Key Codes

A **key code** is a number assigned to each key on the keyboard. To find the key code for a particular key, go to [http://keycode.info](http://keycode.info/), press the key, and look under *key.code*.

When we use key codes in a program, we should make them global constants so that our code is more easily readable. Otherwise, we might get confused over which number is which.

```js
const W_KEY = 87; // all retrieved from http://keycode.info
const A_KEY = 65;
const S_KEY = 83;
const D_KEY = 68; 
const SPACE_KEY = 32;
```
