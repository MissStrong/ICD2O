### Keycodes

A **keycode** is a number assigned to each key on the keyboard. To find the keycode for a particular key, go to [http://keycode.info](http://keycode.info/), press the key, and look under *key.code*.

When we use keycodes in a program, we should make them global constants so that our code is more easily readable. Otherwise, we might get confused over which number is which.

```js
const W_KEY = 87; // all retrieved from http://keycode.info
const A_KEY = 65;
const S_KEY = 83;
const D_KEY = 68; 
const SPACE_KEY = 32;
```

We could also use these built-in constants that are already built-into P5.js:

* `BACKSPACE` (keycode: 8)
* `ENTER` (keycode: 13)
* `ESCAPE` (keycode: 27)
* `LEFT_ARROW` (keycode: 37)
* `UP_ARROW` (keycode: 38)
* `RIGHT_ARROW` (keycode: 39)
* `DOWN_ARROW` (keycode: 40)
