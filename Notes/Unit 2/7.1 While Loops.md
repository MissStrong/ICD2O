### draw()

We have the built-in function `draw()` that is called repeatedly until the program is terminated. For example, the program below keeps drawing squares one by one.

```js
let x = 0;

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    frameRate(5); // slows down the frame rate so that we can see the squares
    fill(0);
}

function draw() {
    rect(x, 0, 25); // draws a square
    x += 50; // updates the coordinates for the next square
}
```

If we wanted the squares to show up all at once, one option is to type out `rect()` twelve times, but that is tedious and unnecessary. 

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(600, 600);
    background(255);
    fill(0);
    rect(0, 0, 50); // Note: Don't actually do it this way!
    rect(50, 0, 50);
    rect(100, 0, 50);
    rect(150, 0, 50);
    rect(200, 0, 50);
    rect(250, 0, 50);
    rect(300, 0, 50);
    rect(350, 0, 50);
    // right at this point, everything shows up on the canvas
}
```

### While Loop

What we can do instead is use a **loop structure**, which repeatedly executes a specified block of code. This process of repetition is called **iteration**. There are two common types of loops: ***while* loops** and ***for* loops**.

The structure of a *while* loop is almost identical to an *if* statement. The difference between the two of them is that we use the keyword `while` instead of `if` and the body is run repeatedly as long as the boolean expression is `true`.

In the previous example, each line is almost identical with the exception of the coordinates. What we can do is store the coordinate as a variable and repeatedly call `rect(x, 0, 25)` and `x += 50`.

```js
let x = 0; // a variable called x is getting initialized

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    fill(0);
    while (x < 400) { // we're checking if x is still less than 600
      rect(x, 0, 25); 
      x += 50 // the x variable is getting updated
    }
}
```

Now the program will show the squares all at once. This is because the canvas doesn't get updated until after all the lines in `setup()` have been executed.

When we are creating our own loops, one thing to be aware of is avoiding **infinite loops**. These loops run indefinitely and anything that is supposed to happen after it will not run. They happen when the boolean expression is never `false`. 

Here is an example of an infinite loop. This program will not show anything on the screen.

```js
let x = 0; // the coordinate of the first square is (0, 0)

function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    background(255);
    fill(0);
    while (0 <= x) { // the next two lines will keep repeating as long as 0 <= x (which is always!)
        rect(x, 0, 25); 
        x += 50;
    }
    // right at this point, everything should show up on the canvas (but it doesn't!)
}
```
