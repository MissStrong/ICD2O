### The `fill()` Function 

By default, the inside of a shape is white. To change the inside colour of a shape, we use the `fill()` function. This tells the program that the inside of *all the shapes* from now on will be this colour.

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  
  fill(255, 165, 0); // makes the inside orange
  rect(130, 90, 260, 120); // rectangle
  ellipse(370, 190, 140, 200); // ellipse
}
```

### The `stroke()`Â Function

By default, the outline of a shape is black. To change the outline colour of a shape, we use the `stroke()` function. This tells the program that the outline of *all the shapes* from now on will be this colour.

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  
  stroke(128, 0, 128); // makes the outlines purple
  rect(130, 90, 260, 120); // rectangle
  ellipse(370, 190, 140, 200); // ellipse
}
```
