### RGB Values

All colours that can be displayed on a computer can be expressed using a combination of 24 zeros and ones (i.e. binary digits, a.k.a. bits). One of the most common ways of indicating a colour is to use its red-green-blue (**RGB**) value. An RGB value shows how to create the colour using combinations of red, green, and blue light. It is often represented as a **tuple** in which each number is an 8-bit integer ranging from 0 (no light) to 255 (a lot of light). Like a coordinate, a tuple is an ordered sequence of numbers surrounded by parentheses.

Here are the RGB values of common colours.

| Colour | RGB value |
| --- | --- |
| Black  | (0, 0, 0) |
| White  | (255, 255, 255) |
| Red    | (255, 0, 0) |
| Orange | (255, 165, 0) |
| Yellow | (255, 255, 0)  |
| Green  | (0, 255, 0) |
| Blue   | (0, 0, 255) |
| Purple | (128, 0, 128) |
| Pink   | (255, 192, 203) |

### The `background()` Function

We can use `background()` to change the colour of the canvas. If we give it one parameter between 0 and 255, the background will be a black, white, or grey colour. If we give it three parameters between 0 and 255, the background will be an RGB colour.

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  background(255, 165, 0); // makes the background orange
}
```

### The `fill()` Function 

By default, the inside of a shape is white. To change the inside colour of a shape, we use the `fill()` function. This tells the program that the inside of *all the shapes* from now on will be this colour.

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  
  fill(255, 165, 0); // makes the inside orange
  rect(130, 90, 260, 120); // rectangle
  ellipse(370, 190, 140, 200); // ellipse
}
```

### The `stroke()`Â Function

By default, the outline of a shape is black. To change the outline colour of a shape, we use the `stroke()` function. This tells the program that the outline of *all the shapes* from now on will be this colour.

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  
  stroke(128, 0, 128); // makes the outlines purple
  rect(130, 90, 260, 120); // rectangle
  ellipse(370, 190, 140, 200); // ellipse
}
```
