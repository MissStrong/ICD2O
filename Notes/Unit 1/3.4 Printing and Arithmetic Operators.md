### The print() Function

The `print()` function writes information in the **console**.

This is useful for letting us see what values our variables are storing.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
    print("Width: ", width);
    print("Height: ", height);
}

```

`"Width: " is called a **string**. Strings are used to represent text and are enclosed in double quotation marks `"` or single quotation marks `'`.
