### Screen Coordinates

Coordinates in programming are usually different from coordinates in math. 

In math, 2-dimensional coordinates can be graphed on a Cartesian Plane like this:

![](../../Images/Cartesian_Plane.jpg)

In computer science, we usually don't use the Cartesian plane for coordinates. Instead, the coordinate system we use looks like this:

![](../../Images/Coordinate_Plane.jpg)

For example, if we are referring to a specific pixel in an image, we would use this coordinate system instead of the Cartesian plane. 

The coordinate (0, 0) is referred to as the **origin**. In P5.js, the origin is the top-left corner, not the center like in math.
