### Functions

A **function** is a set of instruction that achieves something specific. When we want these instructions to run, we **call** the function. Every function has a name and the name is followed by a set of parentheses. 

There are two types of functions in programming: **built-in functions** and **custom functions**. Built-in functions are built into the programming language whereas custom functions are functions that we create ourselves. 

### The `setup()` Function

The first built-in function we'll be looking at is `setup()`. The `setup()` function is automatically called once when the program is run. By default it doesn't do anything, but it is **overrideable**, meaning we can change what it does.

To override `setup()`, we write the following:

```javascript
function setup() {
  
}
```

Inside the curly braces `{}` we write the code we want to run during the setup.

### The `createCanvas()` Function

The second built-in function we'll be looking at is the `createCanvas()`. This function creates the canvas for us to draw our sketch, but before it can do that it needs to know how big to make the canvas. Whenever a function requires additional information called **parameters**, we put the values of the parameters inside the parentheses, separated by commas. These values are called **arguments**.

The `createCanvas()` function requires two parameters: the width of the canvas and the height of the canvas, in pixels. Let's suppose we want a canvas that is 500px by 300px. We can do that with this line of code:

```javascript
createCanvas(500, 300);
```

The semicolon `;` at the end indicates the end of a **statement**. Calling a function is one example of a statement.

We always want to create the canvas during the setup, so we put the following line in the **body** of `setup()`. The body of a function is the space between the curly braces.

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 300);
}
```

Notice the tab space in front of `createCanvas(500, 300);`. Whenever we write code within curly braces, each line will have one more preceding tab space compared to the line with the opening curly brace. 

### `windowWidth` and `windowHeight`

A **variable** stores a value. The value can vary, hence the name *vary-able*. The first two built-in variables we'll look at are `windowWidth` and `windowHeight`. These variables store the dimensions of the window that the canvas will go on. The values depend on the size of the browser. To create a canvas with the maximum dimensions, we can use `windowWidth` for the width of the canvas and `windowHeight` for the height of the canvas.

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}
```

### `width` and `height`

The next two built-in variables we'll be looking at are `width` and `height`. Once we call `createCanvas()`, these two variables store the width and height of the canvas. We can use these values throughout the program.

### The Console

The console is the window in the bottom-right corner that says "console" above it. To make it appear, click on the wrench icon (ðŸ”§) within the webview window. The console is used to interact with the program while it is running. Whenever we get a error, we will see a red error message there.
